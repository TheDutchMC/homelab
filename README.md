# homelab
Scripts &amp; other bits I use in my homelab!

## Directory structure
- ``/Docker/``: Docker-Compose yaml files
- ``/K8s/``: Everything related to Kubernetes
- ``/services``: Everything that runs standalone, and configurations for Docker containers

Feel free to use this for your own usage. PRs are welcome

I'm not responsible for breaking anything :)
